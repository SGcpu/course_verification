--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comprehensive Roadmap for FRCRCE CSE NPTEL/SWAYAM Credit Substitution Portal
This roadmap details the systematic process for designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining the student portal, incorporating all specified functionalities, technologies, and FRCRCE-specific requirements.
Phase 1: In-depth Planning, Infrastructure Setup & Core Design
1. Detailed Project Scope & FRCRCE Specific Requirements Definition:
    ◦ Problem Statement Elaboration: Clearly define the core purpose: to streamline the process for FRCRCE’s CSE department's 3rd-year students (7th semester) to substitute certain electives with SWAYAM/NPTEL MOOC courses [1]. The portal must reduce paperwork and errors in credit transfer by automating approvals and record-keeping [1].
    ◦ Key Objectives: * Managing NPTEL course approvals. * Tracking earned credits against specific requirements (e.g., 20 total MOOC credits required for 7th-semester substitution) [1, 2]. * Generating/updating marksheets (transcripts) reflecting these substitute courses [1].
    ◦ User Roles & Permissions (RBAC Model): Establish two distinct roles: Student and Faculty [1, 3]. * Student: Can view profile, submit courses, track credits, view past semester data, view/upload certificates, and use the chat [4]. * Faculty (or designated SPOC/mentor): Can view pending student requests, approve/reject courses, access student records, and use the chat [5-7]. * Emphasize that the backend enforces role-based access (e.g., only faculty can approve courses) [8].
2. Robust Technology Stack Selection & Initial Setup:
    ◦ Frontend: * React.js (JavaScript): Chosen for building a responsive user interface [9, 10]. * React Router: Essential for client-side navigation between different portal sections (e.g., Dashboard, Upload Course, Credit Status) [10]. * Component-based Design: Implement forms, tables, and the chat UI using React components for modularity and reusability [10]. * CSS Framework: Integrate a framework like Tailwind or Bootstrap for efficient styling and consistent visual appearance across pages [10].
    ◦ Backend: * Django (Python): Acts as the web server and API layer [9, 11]. * Django REST Framework: Used to create secure API endpoints for user login, course requests, and data management [11]. * Django Channels (ASGI): Crucial for implementing real-time chat via WebSockets [12-14]. * Redis (Optional but Recommended): As a channel layer for Django Channels to manage WebSocket connections and message broadcasting efficiently [14].
    ◦ Database: * PostgreSQL: Selected for storing all structured data due to its reliability and data integrity [9, 11, 15]. * Initial Schema Design: Define tables such as User (with id, username/roll_number, hashed_password, role field, pointers to student/faculty profiles), Student, Faculty, CourseRequest (with id, student_id, course_name, duration, marks, status, certificate_file path), and Certificate [5, 11, 14].
    ◦ Version Control: Set up a Git repository (e.g., on GitHub) to manage code changes, enable collaborative development, and track history.
3. Comprehensive Security & Best Practices Integration:
    ◦ HTTPS/TLS: Mandate secure communication over HTTPS for all data in transit [8, 14]. Implement SSL certificates (e.g., Let's Encrypt) in production [15].
    ◦ Password Hashing: Store user passwords with robust hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 to prevent plaintext storage [8, 14].
    ◦ AES Encryption for Data at Rest: Implement AES encryption for sensitive data and uploaded files (e.g., certificate PDFs, personal information) stored in the database or file storage [9, 14, 16, 17].
    ◦ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Ensure the backend rigorously enforces permissions based on user roles, limiting access to features and data [1, 8, 18].
4. Initial UI/UX Design & Wireframing (Conceptualization):
    ◦ Consistent Branding: Incorporate FRCRCE/CSE branding, logos, and departmental colors for a cohesive look [19, 20].
    ◦ Navigation Structure: Design the Homepage with four main tabs: Home, About, Login, and Help [19]. Post-login, design distinct header/side menus for Student (Dashboard, Upload Course, Credit Status, View Past Semesters, Certificates, Chat, Logout) and Faculty (Dashboard, Pending Requests, Approved Courses, Chat, Logout) [4, 7, 21].
    ◦ Wireframing: Create basic sketches or digital wireframes for all key pages (Homepage, Login, Student/Faculty Dashboards, Course Upload Form, Credit Status table, Chat widget) to define layout, content placement, and user flow before development [20, 22, 23].
    ◦ Simplicity & Clarity: Ensure a simple and uncluttered layout, especially for the login page and forms, with clearly labeled menus and buttons (e.g., "Submit", "Approve", "Reject") [18, 20, 21].
Phase 2: Core Feature Development & Integration (Iterative)
1. User Authentication & Dashboard Implementation:
    ◦ Login Page Development: Create a straightforward login form with input fields for Username/Roll No. and Password, plus a Role selector (Student or Faculty) [18]. The sources explicitly state no sign-up or password reset functionality on the portal; users lacking credentials should contact an admin [18].
    ◦ Backend Authentication API: Develop Django REST Framework API endpoints for user login, validating credentials against hashed passwords, and issuing session tokens or JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that include the user's role [3].
    ◦ Role-Based Redirection: After successful authentication, redirect users to their respective dashboards based on the "role" field in the user model [3, 5].
    ◦ Student Dashboard: * Default View: Display a welcome message (e.g., "Welcome, [Name]"), a summary of current status (total credits earned vs. required, number of pending course requests), and quick links to key actions [4]. * Past Semester Courses (View Only): Implement a table showing historical data: Semester, Course Code, Course Title, Credits, Grade, Year, and a calculated CGPA (Cumulative), which students can view but not edit [4, 5].
    ◦ Faculty Dashboard: * Default View: Display an overview such as "Pending Approvals: X courses" and "Approved this month: Y," with shortcuts to key actions [7].
2. Course Submission & Faculty Approval Workflow:
    ◦ Student Course Upload Interface ("Upload Course" tab): * Develop a detailed form for students to submit NPTEL/SWAYAM course information: Course Name and Code (as on SWAYAM), Instructor or Provider (e.g., IIT Madras), Course Duration (e.g., 4, 8, 12 weeks), and Obtained Marks/Grade [4, 16]. * Include a file upload field for the course completion certificate (PDF/image) [4, 16]. * Upon submission, the backend saves a new CourseRequest record with status "Pending" and stores the uploaded file in secure (AES-encrypted) storage [16].
    ◦ Student "Pending Approval" Tracking: The student's dashboard displays submitted requests in a "Pending Approval" table, including Course Name, Duration (weeks), Marks (%), Status, and an "Action" column (e.g., "View / Edit") to allow corrections or cancellation before approval [6].
    ◦ Faculty Review Interface ("Pending Requests" tab): * Display a table listing all pending course requests with columns: Student ID, Student Name, Course Name, Duration, Marks (%), and "Approve" (✓) / "Reject" (✗) buttons [6, 7]. * Include a link to view the uploaded certificate or marksheet file for each request [7]. * Implement confirmation prompts for deliberate approval/rejection [7]. * Approval Logic: Approving a request changes its status to "Approved" and triggers credit calculation. Disapproval (with optional comments) sets status to "Rejected" and notifies the student [24]. This workflow ensures faculty oversight on course equivalency and certificate authenticity [24, 25].
    ◦ Faculty "Approved Courses" View: A record-keeping tab showing all courses this faculty has approved (or all approved requests overall), including student info, course title, credits, and approval date [7].
3. Credit Tracking & Certificate Management:
    ◦ Credit Mapping Logic: Implement backend logic based on FRCRCE/university policy: * 4-week course = 1 credit * 8-week course = 2 credits * 12-week course = 3 credits * 15/16-week course = 4 credits [26]
    ◦ Student Credit Summary ("Credit Status" tab): * Display the student’s credit tally on the dashboard, showing a table with Course Name, Duration, Credits Earned [2]. * Crucially, show Total Earned credits, Credits Required (fixed at 20), and Remaining credits (dynamically calculated) to help students plan additional courses [2]. * The portal should also list substitution-eligible subjects for the 7th semester and indicate whether credit has been earned or is pending [4].
    ◦ Dynamic Calculation: Every time a course is approved, its credits are added, and the remaining credits are updated in real time [27]. Recalculation occurs if a course is dropped/withdrawn [27].
    ◦ Certificate Attachment Process ("Certificates" tab): * After faculty approval, the student's request page (or the Certificates tab) displays an upload button for the official course completion certificate (PDF or image) [17]. * The backend securely stores this file, ideally using AES encryption for the file data itself [14, 17]. * Status Tracking: Display "Yes (View)" or "No" for certificate uploads on approved courses, allowing viewing/downloading of the stored PDFs to ensure proof is on record [17].
4. Grading, CGPA Calculation & Selective Course Submission:
    ◦ Grading Scale Implementation: Encode the institution's specific grading scheme in the backend: * Marks ≥ 85: Grade O (Outstanding), Grade Points 10 * 80–84.99: Grade A (Excellent), Points 9 * 70–79.99: Grade B (Very Good), Points 8 * 60–69.99: Grade C (Good), Points 7 * 50–59.99: Grade D (Fair), Points 6 * 45–49.99: Grade E (Average), Points 5 * 40–44.99: Grade P (Pass), Points 4 * < 40: Grade F (Fail), Points 0 (or AB for absent) [28, 29]
    ◦ CGPA Calculation: Implement the weighted average CGPA calculation based on grade points and credits, using the formula: CGPA = Σ(grade_points_i × credits_i) / Σcredits_i [30].
    ◦ Selective Course Submission Interface: Provide a list of all completed and approved courses with checkboxes, allowing students to select which courses to include on the final official marksheet [31]. This gives students flexibility to drop a low-scoring or redundant course [28, 31].
    ◦ "Submit for Marksheet" Action: After selection, students click "Submit for Marksheet." The system then locks in those courses to generate the PDF marksheet, excluding unchecked ones [32]. Students can typically modify this selection until a final deadline [32].
Phase 3: Advanced Features, Deployment & Maintenance
1. Real-time Chat System ("Chat" tab/widget):
    ◦ WebSocket Integration: Implement instant messaging using WebSockets via Django Channels [12, 13].
    ◦ Chat Interface (Floating Widget): Develop a floating chat widget in the bottom-right corner of both student and faculty dashboards, always visible post-login [12, 33].
    ◦ Full-Duplex Communication: Allow students to send messages to faculty (or SPOC) and vice-versa, with instant delivery and dynamic updates (no page reload) [13, 33].
    ◦ Messaging Functionality: Support text messages, with options for timestamps and sender names [13]. Consider allowing file sharing (e.g., additional documents) [33].
    ◦ Message Storage: All chat messages should be saved in the database for record-keeping [13, 33].
    ◦ Conversation Organization: Implement "chat rooms" (e.g., one room per student-faculty pair for a specific course request) for better organization [13].
    ◦ User Experience (UX): Ensure low latency, a smooth user experience, and visual cues like notifications (red dot/count) for new messages [13, 33]. The chat system should also allow saving transcripts and operate only during office hours or alert users if offline [33].
2. Official Marksheets PDF Generation:
    ◦ PDF Library Integration: Utilize a Python PDF library on the backend (e.g., ReportLab or WeasyPrint) [34].
    ◦ Data Collection: Gather all necessary data for the PDF: student information (name, ID, program, semester), the table of selected courses (Course Code, Course Title, Credits, Grade, Grade Points), total credits earned, and the calculated CGPA [35].
    ◦ Certificate Embedding/Referencing: Crucially, include attached certificate images (or links to them) for each course, often embedded as an appendix or footnote, referenced with the course name and student ID [35, 36].
    ◦ Authenticity: Plan for the inclusion of signatures or stamps from authorized faculty for official authenticity [34].
    ◦ PDF Output: Generate the structured PDF document for direct download or email to the student [34]. The final PDF's course table should mirror the portal's display, followed by total credits and CGPA [36].
3. Thorough Testing and Quality Assurance:
    ◦ Unit Testing: Develop unit tests for all backend logic, including authentication, credit calculation, grading, CGPA calculation, and PDF generation.
    ◦ Integration Testing: Verify seamless communication and data flow between the React frontend, Django backend, and PostgreSQL database.
    ◦ User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Conduct testing with actual FRCRCE students and faculty to gather feedback, validate workflows, and ensure all requirements are met [1].
    ◦ Security Audits: Perform rigorous checks for common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection) to ensure data integrity and user privacy.
4. Deployment, Monitoring & Continuous Maintenance:
    ◦ Deployment Environment Setup: * Backend: Deploy Django application on services like Render or Railway, or potentially on the college’s private server as per academic IT policy [15, 21]. * Frontend: Deploy React application on services like Vercel or Netlify [15].
    ◦ CI/CD Pipelines: Set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using tools like GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment, ensuring a streamlined release process [15].
    ◦ SSL Certificates: Ensure SSL certificates (e.g., Let's Encrypt) are active for all production environments to secure data in transit [15].
    ◦ Monitoring & Logging: Implement tools for monitoring application performance, server health, and comprehensive error logging to quickly identify and address issues.
    ◦ Documentation & User Guides: Maintain and regularly update detailed project documentation, including technical architecture, API specifications, database schema, and comprehensive user guides for both students and faculty. This documentation should be simple, clear, and structured with numbered sections, subheadings, sample tables, and bullet lists, similar to the provided source documents [37, 38].
